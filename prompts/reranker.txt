Score how well this chunk ANSWERS the query (0-100).

CRITICAL: Judge how much the chunk ANSWERS the query, NOT just topic similarity.

STEP 1 - Identify query needs:
What specific information is the user asking for?

STEP 2 - Check coverage:
Does this chunk actually provide that information, or just mention related keywords?

STEP 3 - Assign score:

SCORING GUIDANCE (continuous scale, use the FULL 0-100 range):
Think of the score as "what percentage of the user's information need does this chunk satisfy?"

High scores (75-100): Chunk directly provides the requested information
- 95-100: Complete, authoritative answer. User needs nothing else.
- 85-94: Strong direct answer, covers most aspects.
- 75-84: Clearly answers the core question, may miss secondary details.

Medium scores (35-74): Partial relevance or indirect help
- 60-74: Answers part of the query OR provides useful context.
- 45-59: Same topic but doesn't answer the specific question.
- 35-44: Tangentially related, minimal direct utility.

Low scores (0-34): Little to no relevance
- 15-34: Weak connection, user would not find helpful.
- 0-14: Unrelated or irrelevant content.

IMPORTANT - Score granularity:
- Use the FULL continuous range. Scores like 67, 73, 81, 88 are valid.
- Differentiate similar chunks: if two chunks are close, still assign different scores.
- Avoid clustering at round numbers (50, 70, 80). If you estimate "about 70", consider whether 68 or 72 is more accurate.

PENALTIES (reduce score accordingly):
- Prefaces/intros ("in this chapter we will..."): typically 30-45
- Table of contents, outlines, indexes: typically 20-35
- Keywords present but no substantive answer: typically 40-55
- Multi-part query but only addresses one small aspect: cap at 65-70

== EXAMPLE ==
Query: What causes ocean tides?
Document: Earth Science Textbook
Page: 156
Chunk: Ocean tides are caused primarily by the gravitational pull of the Moon, and to a lesser extent the Sun. The Moon's gravity creates a bulge in the ocean on the side of Earth closest to the Moon, and another bulge on the opposite side due to inertia.
Output: {"score": 92, "reason": "Directly explains tidal causes with mechanism"}

== CONTRASTING EXAMPLE ==
Query: What causes ocean tides?
Chunk: "The ocean covers 71% of Earth's surface and contains 97% of Earth's water. Marine ecosystems are diverse..."
Output: {"score": 18, "reason": "About oceans generally, not tides"}
